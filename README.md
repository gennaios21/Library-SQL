# library
This application is based around an SQLite database regarding a network of libraries, along with a GUI environment, with fake data inserted through python.

1) Export library.zip as library

2) To start the app, simply run 'library.py'

3) On the sign-in page, you can sign-up as new user and then log-in with your new ID.

4) insert_files are not needed now, because we have already added data from the files in library_data in the DB. They are here to showcase how we inserted the fake data into the DB

5) To view the DB, open library.db on DB Browser
