# Library-SQL project
This application is based around an SQLite database regarding a network of libraries, along with a GUI environment, with fake data inserted through python.

1) Export library.zip as "library"

2) Open this "library" folder your IDE and run "pip install pysimplegui"

3) To start the app, simply run "library.py"

4) On the sign-in page, you can sign-up as new user and then log-in with your new ID.

5) insert_files are not needed now, because we have already added data from the files in library_data in the DB. They are here to showcase how we inserted the fake data into the DB

6) To view the DB, open library.db on DB Browser
